# Acoutic glitches

This repository can be used to study the glitch signatures arising from the helium ionization zone and the base of convective envelope. Their properties can be extracted following two different approaches:

1. by fitting individual oscillation frequencies
2. by fitting second differences of frequencies w.r.t. the radial order.  

The above methods are described in Verma et al. (2019) in some detail (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.483.4678V/abstract).

## About

This is forked from [kuldeepv89/GlitchPy](https://github.com/kuldeepv89/GlitchPy). I have added pip-install functionality. These changes were made for me to be able to compare glitch fitting methods easily. I do not intend to change the methods used in this package. If you would like to use this module, see installation instructions below. 

## Installation

To install the latest version of this package to your Python environment, use these commands in your terminal emulator,

```
git clone https://github.com/alexlyttle/GlitchPy.git
pip install GlitchPy
```
