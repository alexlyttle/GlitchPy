# Acoutic glitches
This repository can be used to study the glitch signatures arising from the helium ionization zone and the base of convective envelope. Their properties can be extracted following two different approaches:
1. by fitting individual oscillation frequencies
2. by fitting second differences of frequencies w.r.t. the radial order.  

The above methods are described in Verma et al. (2019) in some detail.
